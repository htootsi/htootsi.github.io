Californication, Season 5, episode 4, 2012

“Hi, are you okay?”

“Mmm…yeah, just licking my wounds. The chick really leveled me, didn’ t she?!”

“Yes, she got you pretty bad. Took me back to some of our greatest hits.”

“Oh how I miss our fights at fancy!”

“Oh, oh… I don’t…”

“Hah…You know, when you and Bates got together I was kinda happy cause I thought it was fucking loonacy and it’ s never gonna work. But it does…I guess.”

“It’ s been kind of nice in a way though. Not having to watch you fall in love with someone else. But I don’ t want you to be lonely.”

“Aaa….psshh….I’m not lonely.”

“Yes you are! Yes you are. You are like this little boy in Lassie. Who kind of …it didn’ t work out between us and you are still pouting …you picked up your little ball and you run home and you never ever going to play with anyone else again.”

“I guess being in New York makes it easier to forget that I still love the shit out of you ….yeah, wow….I said that out loud didn’ t i?!”

“So? I still love you. I always will….till the day I die, but at some point I had to choose happiness. I had to make that a priority. I mean…and now I am with someone who understands that I never stop loving you and that makes me happier than I have ever been.”

“Good…hm..haha…that’ s just fantastic….”

“You know… she’ s right. You are wonderful. You are! And when women get to know you, of course they want more. But it’ s kinda a cruel to let them think that they can have it when really it is no more than a hologram.”

“It’ s just a popular belief… you know I am not out there to hurt anyone.”

“I know…what do you think Becca is suffering from now? Some guy, good or bad, has charmed his way into her heart and obviously she wants more.”

“Are you trying to tell me that I have given her some horrible daddy complex?”

“No…no…Don’ t worry about her. I am talking about you. Worry about yourself. Cause really….if all your life is, is series of fucking meaningless flings and some idealized vision of our love story…then I’m really sad for you. Because I know what you are capable of.”

“Yeah, but what if you’ re wrong? What if this is it for me? What if I am just destined to sit around and wait for the band to get back together?”

“You’ll be waiting on a miracle…”

———————————–

Fiction is one. Reality something else. Yet tied so tightly. Reality feeding the hungry fiction and taking the cruel sadness of loneliness to another world where we can see it from distance. To evaluate and analyze. To be behind the safety glass to observe and to reflect upon.

How many people can you pick out of your life and relate to the dialogue above? Similar situation? A friend? A moment of same feelings? The distant observation of someone’ s relationship?

When is too early to give up? When does it get too painful to hold on? When do we cut ourselves off of that comfortable drip that keeps us fed? When do we peel the patch off? When does hope turn into loneliness and loneliness to misery? When do we know it’ s time to make the next step? When to seal the deal or walk away and close the door behind us? How much we need to go through to come to the realization that the most loved ones are better left to lead their lives and just disappeare  to secretly still carry them in your heart?

It is a beautiful thing to love someone for the rest of your life. Do you need to be with that person tho? As a man and woman? There is love that makes your head spin and makes you happy and then there is love that fills you with warmth and something much more profound than simple singular happy moment in time. One love is not less significant than the other, it’ s just different. And finally there is love when these  previous two elements are combined. We call it rare. So does it really sound stupid to have these two different loves at completely different times in your life?

To me, people who love someone in the warmest way and carry them along with them for lifetime, are the most beautiful creatures. The depth and the sincerity is something from another level. And these people live. The trick is to not get stuck. Once you are stuck, you are doomed. There is time for everything and sometimes all you can do is carry the warmness. I don’ t believe in the fact that there is only one person for everyone. No….it’s pile of horse shit! However I do believe in the fact that you never meet the exact same person and re-create the illusion of past. It’ s sick. Just sick. And simply stupid. And fictional illusion that doesn’ t let you breathe the fresh air.

So…I would like to ask…..

Do you carry someone with you everywhere you go?

Are you being carried by someone?
