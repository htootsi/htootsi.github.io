This project involved the development of an environment that allowed PSI employees to take courses online and access key resources organized based on PSIâ€™s key competencies. PSI University also allows students to interact via SocialCast - an online collaboration tool. It also provides automated certificate creation and follow up learning assessment. The University connects over 4,000 staff members to online learning content and won an ASTD citation for online learning excellence in 2011.
